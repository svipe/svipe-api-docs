## Our story

Svipe is founded by developers and applies a technology-first approach, striving to solve complex problems with awesome technology. The entire platform is based on widely adopted standards such as ICAO Doc 9303, Open ID Connect and X509 Public-key Cryptography. We want to make good, secure and easy identity verification available for every software developerâ€™s toolkit allowing them to focus their innovation on their own applications.

Our mission is to:
- Bring secured identities to the online world

We believe that trust can be created and shared in a privacy-first manner online. Integrity and having control of your data should not be a luxury, it should be a human right.
