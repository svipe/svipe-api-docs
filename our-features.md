# Our features

## Based on real identities

Svipe iD is based on a simple idea; we use the digital information already present in the chip of most Passports, National IDs, and Residence cards. This information is digitally signed by the authorities of the issuing country, which means that the document can’t be forged or cloned without detection. We read the information and verify these signatures for you.

## Quick identity verification

It takes less than a minute to verify an identity document with the Svipe app, and share it securely with your business. No external devices or approvals from banks are required.

## Reach 1 billion users

With 140+ countries issuing biometric passports, there are now more than 1 billion biometric passports in circulation, national identity and residence cards not counted. No other identity standard has the same geographic coverage and more countries are joining the standard every year.

## Privacy by design

Svipe does not store any personal data from identity documents on our servers. After verifying the data that we have read from the user’s document, we return the signed data to the phone and delete it. Then it is only stored encrypted inside the secure vault of your user’s phone and shared only with their explicit permission. That is what we mean with privacy-by-design.

## Cryptographically verified credentials

The user’s identity details are read directly from the chip of their identity document and are cryptographically verified to ensure the content is authentic and that the electronic signature of the issuing authority is valid. With Svipe, you can say goodbye to fake passports or reused identity cards!

## Face scan to stop abuse

Svipe conducts an optional biometric check of the user’s face to make sure they are the legitimate owner of the identity document. We base this check on the cryptographically signed photo retrieved from the identity document and use advanced AI to perform a liveness detection.

## Banking grade authentication

Once your users have identified themselves with Svipe, they can use the Svipe App for passwordless logins on your sites, step-up authentication for high-risk transactions or to replace security questions upon account recovery.
