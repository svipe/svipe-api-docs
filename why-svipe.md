# Why svipe?

Privacy on the internet is becoming increasingly important as more and more personal information is shared online. With the rise of social media, e-commerce, and online banking, personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and financial information is readily available to hackers and cybercriminals. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and a host of other problems.

There are many different ways to identify people online. It usually starts with an email and maybe a recorded IP-address. On many sites one need to create usernames and passwords or to login with social media profiles.

Svipe represent a stronger way of identifying people using Government ID's like passports and National ID-documents. These documents are called biometric when they contain a chip that is machine readable.

## What make SvipeID stand out compared to other ways of identity verification?

1. **Fraud and identity theft**: Online identity verification methods may be vulnerable to fraud and identity theft, as criminals may be able to steal personal information and use it to impersonate someone else.

Svipe stops most versions of fraud and identity theft.

2. **Privacy concerns**: Some online identity verification methods may collect sensitive personal information, such as biometric data or government-issued identification numbers, which can raise privacy concerns.

Even though Svipe verifies biometric data, we do not store any data in clear.

3. **False positives and false negatives**: Online identity verification methods may produce false positives (identifying someone as genuine when they are not) or false negatives (failing to identify someone who is genuine), which can lead to security breaches or other problems.

With Svipe you get a clear - electronically - signed proof with neither false positives and false negatives.

4. **Technical issues**: Online identity verification methods may be vulnerable to technical issues, such as system failures or network outages, which can disrupt the verification process.

With Svipe's decentralised identity credential network(all data stored on people's devices),  the risk for technical issues is mitegated.

5. **Usability**: Some online identity verification methods may be difficult for certain users to complete, such as older adults or people with disabilities.

The Svipe user experience is slick and quick, another benefit is that you only do it once.

6. **Dependence on third-party services**: Many online identity verification methods rely on third-party services, which can create a dependency that may be difficult to manage.

Svipe is built on proprietary code with no third-parties  

7. **Compliance**: Online identity verification systems may be subject to strict compliance regulations, such as GDPR, which can be difficult to adhere to.

Svipe is designed to support GDPR and other privacy standarts.
