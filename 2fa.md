# Svipe as MFA method

Svipe uses modern smartphones as a hardware token with a secured and auditable issuance process. The process of issuing a Svipe token is fully automated, which eliminates the need for human intervention and makes it the ideal choice for remote enrolments.

During the enrolment process, Svipe establishes a robust connection between the user's actual identity and the hardware token. This ensures that the token is associated with the user's real identity and cannot be easily compromised or used by someone else.

Once the connection is established, it can be repeatedly utilised to authenticate the actual identity of the token holder. This means that users can be confident that their identity is secure and that they can rely on Svipe to verify their identity whenever needed.

Svipe is not only capable of authenticating the holder of the token but also has the ability to re-verify their ID-credentials and biometrics whenever necessary. This ensures that the user's identity is always up-to-date and accurate, which is crucial in situations where security is paramount.

Overall, Svipe is a highly secure and reliable solution that provides a seamless and efficient way to authenticate identities, making it an ideal choice for businesses and organisations of all sizes.
